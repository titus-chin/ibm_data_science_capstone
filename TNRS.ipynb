    "According to __[CIC News](https://www.cicnews.com/2020/02/which-cities-in-canada-attract-the-most-immigrants-0213741.html#)__, Canada welcomed more than 341,000 immigrants in 2019 and Toronto has successfully attracted nearly 118,000 immigrants which contribute to almost 35% of the total number of immigrants. **The statistics indicate that most of the immigrants prefer to settle in Toronto over other cities.** Why? __[VisaPlace](https://www.visaplace.com/blog-immigration-law/why-immigrants-settle-in-toronto-heres-10-reasons/)__ has listed out 10 reasons for this question. For me, the most convincing reason is Toronto is Canada’s business and financial capital, that's why immigrants prefer it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto is Canada’s largest city, it has 6 boroughs which are Etobicoke, North York, East York, Central Toronto, York and Scarborough. These 6 boroughs can be further divided into 140 neighborhoods. According to __[City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/moving-to-toronto/about-toronto/)__, Toronto is one of the most multicultural cities in the world due to its large population of immigrants all over the world, each Toronto's neighborhood might be quite different from one another. **Therefore, out of 140 neighborhoods in Toronto, how can immigrants decide which neighborhood suits them best?** This is exactly what I want to resolve in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this project, I will try to build a Toronto's neighborhoods recommender system based on 4 factors including job opportunities, affordability, safety and culture.** So, who would be interested in this recommender system? I can say that at least 118,000 people would and I believe that this number will be growing in the future. And of course, I can't wait to find out which neighborhood suit me best too because I wish to migrate to Canada and settle in Toronto in the future. How about you?"

    "Superb! The sunburst figure shows the top 5 common jobs, languages and food of the Waterfront Communities-The Island clearly and effectively. As you hover over an item of the figure, it will display the infomation like its label and percentage. The color scale of the figure is depending on the percentage of each item, the darker the color, the higher the percentage. One more advantage of sunburst figure is you can click on the category that you are interested in and it will display only the category for you. For example, if you're interested in the jobs category, you can simply click on the 'Jobs', and the sunburst figure will transform and show you the information of jobs only. Once you're satisfied with it, you can click again the 'Jobs', and it will return to its original state. By comparing our choices with the sunburst figure, it proves that the recommender system has done a pretty good job. Waterfront Communities-The Island has almost all the elements that we want such as professional jobs, English and Mandarin languages, and pizza place. Now, let's visualize the crime rate and affordability index of Waterfront Communities-The Island."
