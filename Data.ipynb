    "5. **Culture**: Everyone likes to have fun right? So, it's important to know what are some popular places around each neighorhood. For some people, English is not their first language, so they will prefer certain neighborhoods in which they can still communicate in their mother tongue. Hence, we need to know what non-English language spoken most often at home in each neighborhood."
