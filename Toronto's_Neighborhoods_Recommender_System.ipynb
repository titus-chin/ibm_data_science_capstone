    "According to __[CIC News](https://www.cicnews.com/2020/02/which-cities-in-canada-attract-the-most-immigrants-0213741.html#)__, Canada welcomed more than 341,000 immigrants in 2019 and Toronto has successfully attracted nearly 118,000 immigrants which contribute to almost 35% of the total number of immigrants. **The statistics indicate that most of the immigrants prefer to settle in Toronto over other cities.** Why? __[VisaPlace](https://www.visaplace.com/blog-immigration-law/why-immigrants-settle-in-toronto-heres-10-reasons/)__ has listed out 10 reasons for this question. For me, the most convincing reason is Toronto is Canada’s business and financial capital, that's why immigrants prefer it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto is Canada’s largest city, it has 6 boroughs which are Etobicoke, North York, East York, Central Toronto, York and Scarborough. These 6 boroughs can be further divided into 140 neighborhoods. According to __[City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/moving-to-toronto/about-toronto/)__, Toronto is one of the most multicultural cities in the world due to its large population of immigrants all over the world, each Toronto's neighborhood might be quite different from one another. **Therefore, out of 140 neighborhoods in Toronto, how can immigrants decide which neighborhood suits them best?** This is exactly what I want to resolve in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this project, I will try to build a Toronto's neighborhoods recommender system based on 4 factors including job opportunities, cost of living, safety and culture.** So, who would be interested in this recommender system? I can say that at least 118,000 people would and I believe that this number will be growing in the future. And of course, I can't wait to find out which neighborhood suit me best too because I wish to migrate to Canada and settle in Toronto in the future. How about you?"
